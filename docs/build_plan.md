# DawaLink: Build Plan and Progress

**Updated:** 2026-11-10 · **Status:** 🟡 living: updated at the end of every build step.

This is the one place that says **what is built, what comes next, and what was left for later**. A new session reads it to continue exactly where the last one stopped. Decisions stay in the [decision log](00_decision_log.md); this file only tracks the build.

---

## In short

- **Done:** steps 1 and 2: the code skeleton and the domain core (the exact rules as tested code).
- **No question is waiting.** The pickup-day question (Q1) was decided on 2026-11-10 and applied (§3, §5; decision log §W).
- **Next:** step 3, the database. It starts only when the owner says so.
- **Order:** the agent and its evaluation come before the website screens (`02` §9).

---

## 1. How each step works

1. Claude builds the step and its tests, runs every check, and tries it on the local website.
2. Claude updates this file, the Failure Matrix marks (`09`) and any doc the step touches.
3. The owner checks it, commits and pushes.
4. The next step starts only when the owner says so.

Work happens on `main`, in one commit per step. There are no feature branches (`12` §1).

## 2. The steps

The order was proposed by Claude from `02` §9 ("the agent first"). The owner can change it.

## 3. Log

### Step 1: code skeleton (2026-11-10) ✅

**Built:**
- `docker-compose.yml`: `postgres`, `prepare-db` (runs once), `api`, `worker`, `web`.
- `backend/`:
  - `config.py` (every setting, from environment variables);
  - `api/` (`/health`, the one error format, request IDs, CORS for the website only);
  - `worker/` (the clock-check loop with no tasks yet, and its heartbeat);
  - `ops/` (`prepare_db`, `export_openapi`);
  - Alembic with no migration yet.
- `frontend/`: Vite, React, Mantine with the v2 theme, self-hosted Readex Pro, one temporary status page, API types generated from `docs/openapi.json`.
- `README.md` and `.env.example` at the root.

**Checked:**
- 40 backend tests and 7 website tests pass; ruff, mypy, oxlint and `tsc` are clean.
- `docker compose up --build` runs everything; the status page shows the website, API and database connected, with no browser errors.
- With the database stopped, `/health` still answers `200` and says the database is down (FX-10).

**Details added to the docs:**
- `04` N-40: connecting to the database times out after 2 s.
- `06` §3.2: the error code `METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`.
- `12` §2 and §6: the local database port, and the ALB health check timeout of 6 s.
- `02` §1: the website's linter is oxlint.

### Step 2: domain core (2026-11-10) ✅

**Built** (`backend/src/dawalink/domain/`, plain Python with no database and no network):

| Module | Rules it holds |
|---|---|
| `numbers.py` | Every number of `04` §5 the code uses, by ID |
| `clock.py` | The app clock (system and manual), Beirut time |
| `expiry.py` | Expiry dates, days left, zones, **the expiry fit** (R-F1) |
| `pricing.py`, `money.py` | Discount tiers, the effective price, the early-release suggestion; LBP and USD |
| `opening_hours.py`, `pickup.py`, `windows.py` | Opening hours; pickup days and deadlines; request hours, search windows, offer times |
| `state_machine.py` | Who may make which change |
| `accounts.py`, `orders.py`, `claims.py`, `requests.py`, `early_release.py` | The state machines SM-1, SM-2, SM-5, SM-6, SM-7, SM-8, with their guards |
| `inventory.py` | Stock quantities, protected reserved units, the visibility rule |
| `limits.py` | Open-order and per-medicine limits; the no-show pause |
| `refs.py` | Order and request numbers |
| `allocation.py` | **First come, first served** |
| `search.py` | Search ordering; "5+" availability |
| `planning.py` | **The multi-medicine planner** (`plan_basket`) and the best visiting order |

**Checked:**
- 304 backend tests pass (264 of them for these rules); ruff and mypy are clean; every rule module is fully covered.
- Boundaries from the docs: days left −1, 0, 180, 181, 270, 271; request hours 07:59, 08:00, 20:00; "today" with 60 and 59 minutes of opening time left; the examples of R-F1 and R-T4; both daylight-saving changes of 2026.
- The planner's first plan matches an independent brute-force search on about 290 random baskets, and it answers in 0.3 s at its largest size.
- First come, first served gives the same result however the claims are ordered (INV-17).
- No agent action appears in the order, request, claim or account machines (INV-11).

**Details added to the docs:**
- `04` N-48: a plan visits at most 4 pharmacies, and the planner weighs at most 16.
- `04` R-RQ5: only the plans that cover the most units are returned.

### After step 2: the pickup-day decision (2026-11-10) ✅

The owner decided Q1 (§5): one set of pickup days everywhere, and a later pickup day leaves fewer days before the box expires (decision log §W).

**Built** (rules only; search, the reserve check and the agent's tools use them in steps 4 and 5):
- `domain/pickup.py`:
  - `pharmacy_pickup_days`: the days a pharmacy accepts (today, then its next open days, 3 at most);
  - `pickup_choice`: the days on which one box still lasts, and whether the expiry is what rules a later day out;
  - `upcoming_days`: the 7 days the agent can name (N-49).
- `domain/expiry.py`: `last_pickup_day_that_fits`.

**Checked:**
- 316 backend tests pass (276 of them for the rules); ruff and mypy are clean; every rule module is fully covered.
- The owner's example is a test: a box expiring in 7 days, a pharmacy that allows 3 days. Picked up on the third day, 5 days are left. 2 days of use fit on every day; 7 days of use fit today and tomorrow only; 8 days today only; 9 days never.
- On 500 random opening schedules, the days that fit are always the pharmacy's earliest days, and never more than 4 days are offered.
- `last_pickup_day_that_fits` agrees with the fit rule on every combination tried (about 3,500).

**Docs changed:** `01` v5.3 · `03` v4.5 · `04` v4.3 (R-F1, R-F3, R-F6, N-49) · `06` v1.4 · `07` v1.4 (tools, hard rule 11, case state, worked turn A2) · `08` v1.3 · `09` v1.4 (FA-27) · `11` v1.4 · decision log §W.

## 4. Left for a later step

| What | Joins in |
|---|---|
| `mailpit` in Docker Compose | Step 4, with email |
| The worker's part of FX-10 (pause and retry when the database is down) | Step 4, with its first task |
| FX-13's test that kills the worker in the middle of a pass | Step 4 |
| The `Origin` check on state-changing calls (FS-6) | Step 7 |
| The first Alembic migration | Step 3 |
| The price function in SQL must use whole-number maths, like `pricing.py` (`05` §5 shows a decimal formula) | Step 3 |
| The demo clock's stored offset | Step 3, with the `app_state` table |
| Upload rules (R-U1, R-U2, R-U4, R-U5) and month-only dates in files | Step 4, with uploads |
| Rounding locations and the straight-line travel estimate (R-RT1) | Step 4, with routing |
| The client's early-release limits (R-E5) | Step 4 |
| Retry schedules (SM-12) and the escalation, report and flag states (SM-9 to SM-11) | Steps 4 and 5, with what uses them |
| Search and the check at the tap take the pickup day as a date, and return `pickup_days_allowed` and `expiry_limits_pickup` (`06` v1.4) | Step 4, with search and reservations |
| The agent's tools take `pickup_day`; the context lists the upcoming days; hard rule 11 (`07` v1.4) | Step 5 |
| The reserve board on the v2 canvas still shows two cards ("Today", "Tomorrow"). `11` v1.4 wins: one card per allowed day | Step 8 |

## 5. Found while building: checked, or waiting for a decision

The owner's rule (2026-11-10): **don't follow the docs blindly.** Anything that looks wrong, missing or unproven is checked and tested, then written here.

### Checked

| What | Result |
|---|---|
| The planner assumes an extra stop never shortens a trip. Real road times can be irregular. | Measured on 1,331 random baskets. With regular distances it always finds the best plan. With times bent by up to 30%, 1.7% of baskets get a trip about 2 minutes longer. It never covers fewer units. A test now guards this. |
| The price formula in `05` §5 uses decimals and has no cap at the public price. | The code uses whole numbers and caps the price. The database function must do the same in step 3. |

### Decided

| # | What the docs disagreed on | The owner's decision |
|---|---|---|
| Q1 | **Pickup day.** The rule let a client pick today or the pharmacy's next 1–3 **open** days, but the reserve screen, the search filter and the agent's tools only knew "today / tomorrow". | **2026-11-10:** the rule and the agent use the same pickup days (3 open days at most), as dates. The agent must also know that a later pickup day leaves fewer days before the box expires. Applied in the docs and the rule code (decision log §W, BLD-D1 and BLD-D2). |

### Waiting for a decision

Nothing is waiting.

## 6. Good to know on this laptop

- A Windows PostgreSQL service holds port 5432, so the project's database is at `127.0.0.1:5433`.
- Use `127.0.0.1` for the database, not `localhost`: `localhost` tries IPv6 first here and waits for seconds.
- `npm install` and Docker pulls can take many minutes on this connection.
- Docker Desktop must be running before any `docker compose` command.
